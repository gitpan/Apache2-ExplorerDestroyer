DESCRIPTION
    "Apache2::ExplorerDestroyer" provides three Apache filter modules which
    help you add the three Explorer Destroyer scripts to your site. When
    somebody connects to your website using Microsoft Internet Explorer,
    these filters will encourage them to switch to Mozilla Firefox with
    Google Toolbar.

    You should have a Google AdSense account to take full advantage of this;
    for each user that you convert to FireFox, Google can give you up to $1,
    so you can help save the planet and make some dough at the same time!

    See <http://www.explorerdestroyer.com/> and <http://adsense.google.com/>
    for more information.

HOW TO USE THIS MODULE
    Create a file on your harddrive containing your AdSense button
        The google adsense website lets you pick one of several buttons to
        use in the campaign. Place the button's HTML (typically two sets of
        "script" tags) in a file on your webserver's harddrive.

    Tell "Apache2::ExplorerDestroyer" where to find this file
        In "httpd.conf", add:

          PerlSetVar GoogleScriptFile /path/to/your/google/ad.inc

    Apply the filter where you want
        Eg; This would add a firefox banner to the top of every .html page
        when seen in M$IE:

          <Files "*.html">
            PerlOutputFilterHandler Apache2::ExplorerDestroyer::Level1->handler
          </Files>
  
        The three handlers are as follows:

        PerlOutputFilterHandler Apache2::ExplorerDestroyer::Level1->handler
            Serves the "Level 1" explorer destroyer: an advertisement
            running accross the top of your page.

        PerlOutputFilterHandler Apache2::ExplorerDestroyer::Level2->handler
            Serves the "Level 2" explorer destroyer: an advertisement that
            replaces your page, with a "continue without firefox" button.

        PerlOutputFilterHandler Apache2::ExplorerDestroyer::Level3->handler
            Serves the "Level 3" explorer destroyer: an advertisement that
            replaces your page, locking people out if they are using
            internet explorer.

        See <http://www.explorerdestroyer.com/> for a more complete
        description with demonstrations.

    Congratulations
        You are now helping to spread firefox!
